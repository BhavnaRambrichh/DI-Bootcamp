#Create a basic line plot using the following data, which represents the demand for a product at different price points. Lower prices are usually associated with higher demand:
#x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # Prices
#y = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]  # Demand

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 
y = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

plt.plot(x,y)

plt.show()
